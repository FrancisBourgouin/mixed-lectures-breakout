## Data types

In Python we have basic data types to handle all kind of info like strings, numerical values, true or false with booleans and the lack of information

- String 
- Numeric (int, float, complex) 
- Boolean 
- None

We also have other kinds of data types, mostly to organize content like lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries

- Binary (bytes, bytearray)
- Sequence (list, tuple, ranges)
- Mapping (dict)
- Set (set, frozenset)

Here are some examples of those variables:

```python
  someInteger = 1
  someFloat = 3.14159

  someString = "Hello!"

  someBoolean = True

  someNone = None

  someList = [1,"Hello!",3,True]
  someTuple = (1,True, "Hello!")
  someRange = range(1,10,2)

  someDictionary = {"key":"value"}

  someSet = {"Hola!", 3.14, False}

```
