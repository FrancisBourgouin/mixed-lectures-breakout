# Let's start with Hello World!

# We want to print Hello World in the terminal 





# Let's write some pseudocode first

# First, we need a string containing hello world
# Second, we need a way to print in the console
# Third, we need to put them together


# Let's write the code


print("Hello World!")



# Let's refactor by storing the greeting in a variable


greeting = "Hello World!"

print(greeting, greeting)

# Let's refactor by showing Hello World! twice
# PEMDAS
# Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Substraction

print((greeting + " ") * 5)


# Let's refactor by only outputting Hello
# When we work with a string, we can see it as a list of letters


print(greeting[2:5])



# Let's refactor by only outputting World!
