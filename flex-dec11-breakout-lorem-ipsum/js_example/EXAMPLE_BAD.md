Title: "Help diagnosing and fixing a malfunctioning laptop screen"

Hello everyone,

I have a Dell laptop (model XPS 13) that's been acting up lately. The screen flickers randomly, and sometimes it goes completely black. I've tried restarting, updating drivers, and even reseating the display cable, but the issue persists. Can anyone help me diagnose and fix this problem?

Thanks in advance!

Hi User123,

It sounds like you've done some initial troubleshooting. To determine if this is a software issue, you can try booting your laptop into Safe Mode. This will load only essential drivers and rule out any third-party software causing the problem. Here's how you can do it:

1. Restart your laptop.
2. When the Dell logo appears, repeatedly press the F8 key until you see the Advanced Boot Options menu.
3. Select "Safe Mode with Networking" using the arrow keys and press Enter.

If the screen behaves normally in Safe Mode, it's likely a software issue, and you may need to further investigate recent driver updates or software installations.

Let us know the results, and we can proceed from there.

Hi User123,

If the issue persists in Safe Mode or if you suspect it's a hardware problem, you can perform a quick test to check if the laptop's display is functioning correctly. Connect your laptop to an external monitor or TV using an HDMI cable. Here's what you should do:

1. Connect the HDMI cable to your laptop's HDMI port.
2. Connect the other end of the cable to an available HDMI input on your external monitor or TV.
3. Power on the external display first, then turn on your laptop.

If the external display works flawlessly without any flickering or blackouts, it's more likely that your laptop's built-in screen, display cable, or the display driver is causing the issue. If the problem persists on the external display, it could be a graphics card or motherboard problem.

Let us know the results of this test, and we can provide further guidance.
