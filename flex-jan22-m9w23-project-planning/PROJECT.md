# Project management!

## Step 0: Idea!

There is no idea that is too simple or too hard

It's all about scoping

# Step 1: Initial Planning

Very high level

- User stories
- Mockups / Wireframes
- Management style 

# Step 2: Stack choices

Depends on the goal of the project

### If the goal is to learn a new language / stack

Choose the language, and make it fit.

### If the goal is to have something online fast, and stable

Choose what you know

### Final project

- Express / React (TS / More JS)
- Rails / React (More polyglot)

# Step 3: Moar planning!

- Data structures
- Stack choices
- Monolithic vs Monolithic + API vs Microservices
- Multiple repos vs Monorepo (Monorepo for final project, since the time spent on both is the same and short)

# Step 4: Nitty-gritty

- Build Repo
- Set up Trello/Github Project boards
- Initial split of work.

# Step 5: WORK TIME :D

- Do your work
- Scrum time!
- Review
- Rant

# Step 6: Polishing time!

- Create documentation
- Maybe create a static version
- Prepare presentation
- PARTY!
