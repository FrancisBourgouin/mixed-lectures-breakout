# Welcome to Python ! :D

# Data Types

## String
## Strings comes in two forms, lines and blocks!

### Single line

### Multiple lines


## Numeric
## Numerical values fall into multiple types, depending on the precision needed

### Integers

### Floats

### Complex


## Boolean
## Boolean values are either True or False, make sure to capitalize them in Python!


## None
## None defines the absence of a values, often referred to null, undefined or nil in other languages


## Sequence
## Sequences are types that enables us to hold multiple values together
## The main gotcha between lists and tuples is that a list is mutable, and a tuple is not

### List

### Tuple

### Range

## Set
## Sets contain a list of unique elements, and their order is not safe, very useful when you may have repeated elements


## Dict
## Dictionary data type is a structure where we specify a key and a value as a pair
## The key is either a string or a number

# Conditional Statements

## If
## Using if enables us to set a condition to do a code block
## Else enables a counter point
## Elif enables a second condition if the first one doesn't pass

### If

### If..else

### If..elif..else

# Loops

## While
## While loops take a condition and then run until that condition is fulfilled

## For
## For loops are iterating over the elements of another structure, like a list, tuple, range, etc!
