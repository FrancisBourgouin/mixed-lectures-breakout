# MPA vs SPA!

# Path to build SPA with AJAX

1. Create the HTML (article tag in index.html)
2. Define what the post object would look like (one of the objects in the array in helpers.js)
3. Create a jQuery function that will create the HTML post, but with jQuery (Static / Hardcoded Values)
4. Refactor the jQuery function to accept a post object that is local (helpers.js)
5. Test it with a local array of posts if needed
6. Replace the local object with an AJAX query
7. ...
8. Profit!
